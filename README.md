# Libretro Shader Viewer

An OpenGL-based viewer for Libretro (RetroArch) GLSL shaders.

## Description

This program allows you to view and test Libretro (RetroArch) GLSL shader presets (.glslp) files, applying them to images in real-time. It supports:
- Loading and displaying images
- Loading Libretro shader presets (.glslp)
- Real-time shader parameter adjustment
- Multiple shader passes
- Live preview window

## Dependencies

- OpenGL 3.3+
- GLFW3
- GLAD
- ImGui
- Native File Dialog (NFD)
- CMake (for building)

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

1. Run the program:
```bash
./pixel_shader_viewer
```

2. Use the interface to:
   - Load an image ("Load Image" button)
   - Load a shader preset ("Load Shader Preset" button)
   - Adjust shader parameters using the sliders
   - Preview changes in real-time
